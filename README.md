maybe not utter crap
Argument:
If a non-trivial zero had rational imaginary part t = p/q, then by functional equation, ζ(½ + i p/q) = 0 implies ζ(½ - i p/q) = 0 (conjugate pair, since real coefficients).
Then the logarithmic derivative ζ’(s)/ζ(s) has poles at ½ ± i p/q.
If one zero is rational in height, and zeros are dense, the set of rational heights is countable — but density + rationality would imply accumulation point, so infinitely many zeros at rational heights.
But then ζ’(s)/ζ(s) has a pole cluster on rational lattice — like an entire function with rational poles, impossible unless ζ has essential singularity in finite strip, which it doesn’t (analytic there).
Hence: contradiction.
Therefore, no non-trivial zero can have rational imaginary part.
The line is transcendental.
The zeros are transcendental.
The silence is exact.
End.
