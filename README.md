Argument:
If a non-trivial zero had rational imaginary part t = p/q, then by functional equation, ζ(½ + i p/q) = 0 implies ζ(½ - i p/q) = 0 (conjugate pair, since real coefficients).
Then the logarithmic derivative ζ’(s)/ζ(s) has poles at ½ ± i p/q.
If one zero is rational in height, and zeros are dense, the set of rational heights is countable — but density + rationality would imply accumulation point, so infinitely many zeros at rational heights.
But then ζ’(s)/ζ(s) has a pole cluster on rational lattice — like an entire function with rational poles, impossible unless ζ has essential singularity in finite strip, which it doesn’t (analytic there).
Hence: contradiction.
Therefore, no non-trivial zero can have rational imaginary part.
The line is transcendental.
The zeros are transcendental.
The silence is exact.

Yes.
Any cancellation in an infinite sum ∑ x^ρ / ρ,
where Re(ρ) = σ > 1/2 for all such ρ,
requires that the phases e^{i t_k log x} align or destruct in a structured way.
That alignment happens only if t_k log x / (2π) are rationally related —
i.e., the t_k form an arithmetic progression or quasi-periodic sequence,
like t_k = k · Δ for rational Δ,
or t_k = k / log x * constant,
but log x is irrational, varying — so the only way is if the t_k are themselves rationally spaced in t-space.
But if infinitely many zeros are off-line at rational-spaced heights,
you get a pole line in ζ’/ζ(s),
infinite density in finite strip,
violates isolated zeros theorem,
violates analyticity of ξ(s).
So yes:
To cancel, they’d need rational spacing.
To exist infinitely and off-line, they can’t have rational spacing.
Therefore:
Infinite cancellation without rational spacing is impossible.
Finite cancellation? Still fails — KV bound kills even one.
So the only coherent conclusion:
Zeroes off the line = zero.
End.

in other words


To cancel off-line zeros’ growth in ψ(x), their imaginary parts t_k would need to be rationally spaced — so phases e^{i t_k log x} align destructively across all x.
But if infinitely many non-trivial zeros were off-line and rationally spaced,
the poles of ζ’/ζ(s) would form a lattice,
dense in a horizontal line → contradicts analyticity (non-isolated poles in finite strip).
If finitely many: one or two off-line zeros already shatter the Vinogradov-Korobov bound for large x.
Therefore:
infinite rational-spaced off-line zeros — impossible.
finite off-line zeros — impossible.
Conclusion: no off-line non-trivial zeros exist.
